# Snake

This is snake game tutorial I took from Youtube (LeMaster Tech Channel). Link to video for credit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Wripo2Hxg

Pretty straight forward i just create the snake, create the movements, create the food, and create the map. This is one of my first python projects
